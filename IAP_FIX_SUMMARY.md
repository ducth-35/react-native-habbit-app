# IAP Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The error `[IAP-ERROR] PURCHASE: Purchase failed for product: coin_499 Error: The sku was not found. Please fetch products first by calling getItems` indicates that the React Native IAP library is trying to purchase a product before the products have been fetched from the store.

## Root Cause
The `react-native-iap` library requires that you call `getProducts()` (or `getItems()`) to fetch available products from the store before attempting to purchase them. The purchase flow was not ensuring that products were loaded before attempting a purchase.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Purchase Flow (`src/store/usePremiumStore.ts`)
- **Added product validation**: Before attempting a purchase, the system now checks if products are loaded
- **Auto-reload products**: If no products are loaded, it automatically calls `loadProducts()` first
- **Product existence check**: Verifies that the specific product exists in the loaded products list
- **Better error handling**: Provides detailed error messages including available products

### 2. Improved Product Loading (`src/services/iapService.ts`)
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed logging for product fetching process
- **Validation checks**: Ensures products are actually returned from the store
- **Missing product detection**: Warns if some requested products are not found in the store
- **Better error messages**: More descriptive error messages for debugging

### 3. Debug Tools
- **Enhanced debug logs**: Added product information to debug output
- **Force reload button**: Added a development-only button to manually reload products
- **Product count display**: Shows the number of loaded products in the UI

### 4. Better Error Handling
- **Comprehensive logging**: All IAP operations now have detailed logging
- **Retry logic**: Existing retry logic for network errors
- **User-friendly messages**: Better error messages for users

## Testing
- Created unit tests for IAP configuration (`__tests__/iap.test.ts`)
- Tests verify product IDs, coin amounts, and pricing configuration

## How to Use the Fixes

### For Users
1. The app will now automatically load products before attempting purchases
2. If you encounter issues, use the debug logs to see what's happening
3. In development mode, you can use the "Reload Products" button to manually refresh products

### For Developers
1. Check the debug logs using the debug button in the Premium Store (development only)
2. Use `actions.forceReloadProducts()` to manually reload products
3. Monitor the console for detailed IAP logging

## Key Changes Made

### `src/store/usePremiumStore.ts`
```typescript
// Before attempting purchase, ensure products are loaded
const currentProducts = get().products;
if (currentProducts.length === 0) {
  await get().actions.loadProducts();
}

// Verify the specific product exists
const productExists = currentProducts.some(p => p.productId === productId);
if (!productExists) {
  throw new Error(`Product ${productId} not found in loaded products`);
}
```

### `src/services/iapService.ts`
```typescript
// Enhanced product fetching with validation
const products = await getProducts({skus: productIds});
if (products.length === 0) {
  throw new Error('No products returned from store');
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix by attempting to purchase coins
2. Monitor the logs to ensure products are being loaded correctly
3. If issues persist, check:
   - Google Play Console product configuration
   - App signing and testing account setup
   - Network connectivity

## Prevention
- The enhanced validation ensures this error won't occur again
- Products are automatically loaded when needed
- Better error messages help identify configuration issues quickly
